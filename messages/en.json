	"definition_title": "What is AI Lang?",
	"definition_intro": "AI Lang (Artificial Intelligence Language) is a sophisticated communication language system that goes beyond traditional natural language-based prompt engineering. It enables humans to interact with AI by understanding and utilizing the AI system's internal structure, knowledge access methods, agent collaboration patterns, and context management approaches to deliver human intent most efficiently.",
	"definition_summary": "In other words, it is an independent and structured language for AI that transcends conventional \"prompt writing techniques\".",
	"definition_analogy": "If a prompt is a sentence, AI Lang is more like a 'grammar'.",
	"background_title": "Why is AI Lang needed?",
	"background_intro": "When humans write prompts in natural language, intermediate tools (chatbots, agents, etc.) mix the following elements and deliver them to AI:",
	"background_item_1": "System Prompts",
	"background_item_2": "Context (Memory, Session Information)",
	"background_item_3": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)",

	"background_item_10": "AI Optimization Settings (Temperature, Structured Input, etc.)",
	"background_item_11": "Model Selection and Routing",
	"background_conclusion": "Humans cannot communicate directly with AI. Intermediate tools (chatbots, agents, etc.) mix all the above elements with the user's prompt and deliver it to AI, but humans cannot know what input is actually being delivered. The core concept here is to create 'AI Lang' so that humans can communicate better with AI and control AI behavior more precisely, even through these intermediaries.",
